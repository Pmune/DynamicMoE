Dynamic Mixture of Experts 
This paper  proposes a class of flexible models for modeling the predictive density of a response variable from a complex and time-dependent process. The predictive density is modeled as a mixture of experts model with covariatedependent mixture components and mixture weights. We extend the mixture of experts model by allowing time-varying parameters in both the components and the mixture weights. An efficient particle filtering inference methodology is proposed to sample from the posterior sequentially over time and for making online predictions. The algorithm is designed to handle static or dynamic mixture of experts models with high-dimensional parameter in a unified way. The methodology is evaluated on simulated and real data from a large-scale industrial software project where the aim is to provide online predictions of the number of software faults as new software upgrades are released.
