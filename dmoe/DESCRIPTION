Description: This package implements a Sequential Bayesian inference method for dynamic mixture of experts. 
             A mixture of experts models the conditional density of a 
             response variable using a finite mixture of regression models with
             covariate-dependent mixture weights. The inference method is based on a 
             sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for online inference.
